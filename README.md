# ANN (Artificial Neural Network)

## Overview

ANN is a Java Maven project that provides a ground-up implementation of a neural network. The project includes various components necessary to create and train neural networks, including layers, neurons, and the backpropagation algorithm.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key files:

- `BackPropagation.java`: Implements the backpropagation algorithm used for training the neural network.
- `HiddenLayer.java`: Defines a hidden layer within the neural network.
- `InputLayer.java`: Defines the input layer for the neural network.
- `NeuralLayer.java`: Base class for different types of layers in the neural network.
- `NeuralNet.java`: Main class representing the neural network.
- `Neuron.java`: Defines a single neuron within a layer.
- `OutputLayer.java`: Defines the output layer of the neural network.

## Prerequisites

To build and run this project, you need to have the following installed:

- Java 8 or higher
- Maven 3.6.0 or higher

## Getting Started

### Cloning the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash

Building the Project

Navigate to the project directory and use Maven to build the project:

bash

cd ann
mvn clean install

Running the Project

To run the project, execute the following command:

bash

mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.yourpackage.NeuralNet"

Usage
Initializing a Neural Network

You can initialize a neural network by creating an instance of the NeuralNet class and adding layers to it:

java

NeuralNet neuralNet = new NeuralNet();
neuralNet.addLayer(new InputLayer(numberOfInputs));
neuralNet.addLayer(new HiddenLayer(numberOfNeurons));
neuralNet.addLayer(new O
